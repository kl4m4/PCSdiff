This is a tool for comparing PCSchematic projects. PCSchematic is an electrical cad software.
This tool was created to facilitate maintaining different versions of electrical projects, by showing which pages of 2 projects differ from one another.
It is written in Python 3 (tested in Python 3.5.1), using regexp to parse project files (text), and sqlite to perform comparison between 2 projects.
TO DO:
[x] upload some generic PCSchematic projects for testing purposes.
[x] prepare test.py for such tests
